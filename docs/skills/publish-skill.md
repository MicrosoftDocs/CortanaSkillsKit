# Publishing Cortana Skills  

>[!NOTE]
> This article describes the three deployment groups in Cortana and how to publish a Cortana Skill. You should create a Cortana Skill before proceeding. 
> *   If you have never created a Cortana Skill and need to get started, visit the [Create your first skill](./get-started.md) page.  

Deploy your Cortana Skill to each of the three deployment groups.  
*   [Default Settings](#default-settings)  
*   [Test Group Settings](#test-group-settings) : Not Configured / Configured  
*   [World Settings](#world-settings) : Not Configured / Configured  

All of deployment groups contain the same instance of your Cortana Skill.  
Two identifiers are assigned to your Cortana Skill.  
*   `skillId`  
    *   The identifier (ID) of your Cortana Skill is unique per deployment group. If your skill checks the ID, then verify the IDs are different for each group. You should use the ID of your Cortana Skill if you want to turn on more logging in the group environment.  
*   `skillProductId`  
    *   The product ID of your Cortana Skill is unique across deployment groups.  

Cortana passes the IDs in the channel information of the message.

## Test Group Settings  

Deploying to **Test Group** makes your Cortana Skill available to a group of users that you specify using individual MSA email addresses. Typically, you create a test group to have others test your Cortana Skill and provide feedback. This is done so you are able to update your Cortana Skill before making generally available.

### Common Reasons for Review Failure 

If you read and adhere to the [review requirements](./skill-review-guidelines.md), then you should pass the review.  
There are some common reasons why a Cortana Skill fails the review.  

*   The invocation name does not meet policy requirements.  
*   Your submission does not provide sample invocation phrase.  
    Provide at least three sample invocation phrases that demonstrate your Cortana Skill.  
    Ensure that the invocation phrases actually work.  
    You should provide enough samples that demonstrate all key features.  
*   You provide sample phrases with at least on of the following issues.  
    *   Forget to include a launch word (Ask, Tell, and so on) or invocation name.  
        
        >[!TIP]
        > For a skill called **My Events**  
        > *   `My Events update` : Missing the launch word.  
        > *   `ask for an update` : Missing the invocation name.  
        
    *   The samples do not work as expected or described.  
        
        >[!TIP]
        > If the invocation phrase is `Ask My Events to find a nearby event`, then your Cortana Skill should either return nearby event information or ask for more information.  
        
*   The skill does not provide support for Help. Most first-time users will ask the skill for help (say `Help`). If a user asks for help, then your skill must tell the user how to use the skill.  

    >[!TIP]
    > `Do you want available miles, used miles, or discounts?` or `Please say a stock's name. For example, say Microsoft.` 
    
*   Your skill infringes on the intellectual property (IP) of another company.  
    The name and invocation name of your Cortana Skill should not consist of any trademarked or copyrighted words unless you have permission to do so from the owner. 
    Ensure that you have the right to share the content that your skill provides. 
    >[!TIP]
    > Your skill should not make use of any unlicensed or pirated audio content.  

### Delete Channel  

Deleting a Cortana Skill involves deleting the channel inside the BotFramework portal.  To be able to delete the Cortana channel on a bot, the skill must not be published to **World**.  

If you need to delete a Cortana Skill that is published to **World**, then you must contact the Cortana Certification team. If a skill is under review by the Cortana Certification team, then you must first withdraw your submission before deleting the Cortana channel.  

1.  On the *Configure Cortana* page, at the bottom of all sections, click **Delete Channel** button.  
    
    ![Delete Channel](../images/delete_channel.png)
