# Enterprise onboarding

Developing enterprise skills first requires that your enterprise and developers have Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts. Please see the [Cortana integration in your business or enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/cortana-at-work/cortana-at-work-overview) page for details.

Once the AAD accounts have been created, Microsoft must onboard both your enterprise and your developers for them to be able to create internal enterprise skills. This requires you to send information to Microsoft. In order to get your AAD tenant onboarded to this program, please email the following information to cortanae@microsoft.com:

* AAD Tenant Name
* AAD Tenant ID
* IT Admin Name, email address, and AAD Object ID **[We say above that we're onboarding developers. Do they include this line per developer? Or are the devs onboarded later somehow?]**

Once the tenant is onboarded, developers can begin to build Cortana Enterprise Skills for your organization.
