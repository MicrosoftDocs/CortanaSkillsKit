# Before you start

As with many projects, starting with a design is very helpful. Designing for Cortana skills is different from most other software because of the unique interface. Cortana is designed to driven by voice, and many devices that support Cortana have small screens. It's important to keep these things in mind when designing your skill.

As an example, instead of trying to provide a list of a dozen choices on the screen, remember that your skill can receive choices verbally. For example, for a travel skill, instead of listing possible destination cities on the screen, have your skill listen for a known destination city, and request more information if it doesn't hear one.

## Development workflow

You're free to use whatever workflow suits you best, but we've found that this one works well for creating Cortana skills.
