In previous modules, you learned how to build conversation in your Cortana skill, how to use audio and visual elements, and how to launch apps or web sites from your skill. In this module, you'll learn the basics about Cortana's user profile data, which you'll use in the next module to customize your Cortana skill.

Your user profile information can be found in the Cortana Notebook, which you can view by clicking the Notebook icon in the Cortana canvas.

You can view a variety of information in the Cortana Notebook. For example, you can view a list of your Cortana skills, your preferences for how Cortana manages commute and traffic information, or your cuisine preferences.

You can also update many user profile iteFor example, you can add or remove items from your cuisine preferences by clicking **Add a cuisine** or selecting a cuisine and clicking the trash can icon.

When you are developing a Cortana skill, you can customize the skill to the user by including information from the user profile. For example, with a user's consent you can customize your skill to include the user's name, email address, location, or cuisine preference.
