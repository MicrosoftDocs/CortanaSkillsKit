# Privacy Policy guidelines

Microsoft take user disclosures very seriously. Cortana Skills require you to provide your skill users with a privacy policy explaining how you collect, use, and share user data. Below are some guidelines and third-party resources to help you fulfill these requirements. Please be advised that these resources are provided for your convenience. ***You agree to assume all risk and liability arising from your use of these resources and that Microsoft is not responsible for any issues arising out of your use of them.***


Your privacy policy, together with any disclosures or consents you provide within your skill, must disclose how your skill collects, uses, and shares user data, including the types of parties with whom it's shared. You must limit your use of the data to the activities described in the disclosures. It must also describe the controls that users have over the use and sharing of their information and how they may access their information, and it must comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

Your privacy policy must be kept up-to-date as you add new features and functionality to your skill. You'll need to provide a link to your privacy policy and terms of service with your skill submission for publication in the Cortana Skills Store. Such links will be made available to users in the Cortana Skills Store and related end user facing Cortana Skills description. If you don’t have a privacy statement, here are a couple third-party resources that might be of some assistance:

* Future of Privacy Forum – [Application Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.applicationprivacy.org/do-tools/privacy-policy-generator/)
* Iubenda – [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.iubenda.com/en)

## Next steps

Create your skill's Terms of Use statement. For information, see [Terms of Use guidelines](terms-of-use.md).
