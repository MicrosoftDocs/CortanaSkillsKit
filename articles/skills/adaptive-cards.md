# Use Adaptive Cards in Your Cortana Skill

Cards are interface elements that you may use to enhance the user experience in your Cortana skill.  
The most versatile card is an Adaptive Card. An Adaptive Card is a customizable card that includes any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields.  

## Adaptive Cards  

Adaptive Cards provide the following options.  

*   **Input controls** : Add input controls for text, date, number, time, toggle switch, and choice set.  
*   **Richer text** : Text in your card is not limited to title, subtitle, and text fixed formats. Use a variety of font sizes, formats, and colors.  
*   **A single open card exchange format** : Use your existing cards in a common and consistent way and extend your cards with rich controls using a common schema.  

Adaptive Cards use an open card exchange format. The open card exchange format enables you to specify user interface content in your skill in a common and consistent way. You describe the content as a simple JSON object. The JSON content is natively displayed by the skill and automatically adapts to the look and feel of your skill.  

Adaptive Cards include elements, containers, actions, and inputs.  
A basic Adaptive Card includes the following items.   
*   The Adaptive Card root object.  
*   The Adaptive Card body, which includes the elements of your card.  
*   Any actions for your Adaptive Card, which are typically displayed in an action bar at the bottom of your card.  

## Adaptive Cards Visualizer  

The Adaptive Cards Visualizer provides an interactive preview environment to view and edit the JSON schema of your Adaptive Card and see the results in a preview pane.

## Create an Adaptive Card using .NET

1.  Install the `Microsoft.AdaptiveCards` NuGet package.
2.  Specify the elements of your card in code.
3.  Add the card to your Cortana skill as an attachment.

>[!TIP]
> The following code adds an Adaptive Card to a Cortana skill response.
>
> ```csharp
> var response = context.MakeMessage();
>
> AdaptiveCard card = new AdaptiveCard();
>
> card.Body.Add(new TextBlock()
>     {
>         Text = "This is a test",
>         Weight = TextWeight.Bolder
>         Size = TextSize.Medium,
>     }
> );
>
> response.Attachments.Add(card.ToAttachment());
>
> await context.PostAsync(response);
> context.Wait(MessageReceived);
> ```
